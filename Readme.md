In this exercise we have Designed a frequency warped filter with the following parameters:

* Sampling frequency: 44.1 kHz
* Cutoff frequency: 0.15*pi
* No. of filter coefficients: 6

We have also implemented a minimum phase filter.

# Usage
python frequency_warped_filter.py or python minimum_phase_filter.py
